/**
 * app/filter.js — the S2C safety certificate (Q-CBF), in the browser.
 *
 * This is the paper's whole claim, running: a frozen certificate sits between
 * whatever the policy (or the human) asks for and the plant, and edits the
 * request only as much as the learned value function says it must.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * WHAT IT IS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Three frozen networks from `agent_15000` of the v5prox collision line
 * (`recon/03_safety_filter.md`), shipped as .bin/.json by tools/export_filter.py
 * and run through the SAME app/policy.js MLP the game policies use — the
 * activation is `sin` (`src/tasks/safety/rl/networks.py:42-46`), which that
 * runtime already supports, and there is NO observation normalizer
 * (`filtered_action.py:296-322`; the raw 62-D physical vector enters layer 0):
 *
 *     pi_shield(obs62)          -> u_safe in [-1,1]^12      filter_ctrl
 *     dstb(obs62, u)            -> d      in [-1,1]^6       filter_dstb
 *     Qhat(obs62, u)            = max( Q1(obs,u,d), Q2(obs,u,d) )    filter_q1/q2
 *                                 ("pessimistic = max", filtered_action.py:334)
 *
 * Per robot, per 50 Hz control step (`game_qcbf_action.py:274-293` and
 * `filtered_action.py:438-627`, quoted line by line at each site below):
 *
 *     q_des  = 0.25 * a + q_default            the SAME affine an unfiltered seat uses
 *     u_task = clamp((q_des - target)/0.15, -1, 1)          integrator inverse
 *     u_safe = pi_shield(obs);  V = Qhat(obs, u_safe);  thr = kappa * V
 *     q_task = Qhat(obs, u_task)
 *       q_task >= thr  ->  u_sel = u_task, alpha 0         TASK_PASS
 *       V      <  thr  ->  u_sel = u_safe, alpha 1         FALLBACK
 *       else           ->  u_sel = projected gradient      QP  (see below)
 *     target = applyIncrement(u_sel)           the SAME v25 integrator
 *     prev_ctrl = u_sel                        -> obs[36:48] on the NEXT step
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * THE SOLVER IS THE PROJECTED GRADIENT, NOT THE SECANT
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * `intervention` is absent from this bundle's params/deploy.yaml, so the BUNDLE
 * default is "line_search" — but the bundle does not get the last word. The
 * action term takes the solver from its CFG when the cfg sets it and only falls
 * back to the yaml otherwise (game_qcbf_action.py:117-118), and both shipped
 * S2C seats were trained with that cfg set:
 *
 *   asym_s2c_attacker  logs/.../2026-08-17_22-23-27_v133fdrw/game_6000.pt
 *   asym_s2c_defender  logs/.../2026-08-18_11-55-46_v135fdrw/game_5000.pt
 *
 * whose run_config.yaml both carry, for BOTH seats,
 *
 *   filter: {attacker_ctrl, defender_ctrl}:
 *     ckpt_dir: .../safety_game/collision_v5prox_15k_62d_game
 *     intervention: projected_gradient
 *     pg_step: 0.2   pg_max_iters: 25   pg_backtrack_iters: 12
 *     travel_budget: 5.0
 *
 * (`travel_budget` is a DERIVED display field — runcfg.py:338 writes
 * `pg_step * pg_max_iters` into the view — and gates nothing.)
 *
 * The two solvers resolve the same rows and differ only in WHERE they land:
 * the secant is confined to the 1-D segment towards `u_safe`, the projected
 * gradient solves the actual problem, `argmin ||u - u_task||^2 s.t. Qhat >=
 * kappa V`, in the full 12-D box (filtered_action.py:169-212). Measured on the
 * six intervened fixture cases, the secant moves the action 1.22x to 3.03x
 * further than the gradient solve does for the same safety. That extra travel
 * is what a policy trained under the gradient solve does not expect, and it is
 * what toppled the AI in tests/fall_study.mjs.
 *
 * `_projected_gradient` (filtered_action.py:677-785, itself ported from the
 * vendored reference at safety_GP/filters/intervention.py:281-352) is four
 * steps, all reproduced verbatim below:
 *
 *   1. normalized ascent   u <- clamp(u + eta * g/||g||, -1, 1),  g = grad_u Qhat
 *      tested BEFORE each step, so the first test reads u_task (infeasible by
 *      construction on every row that gets here) and the loop exits the moment
 *      Qhat >= thr;
 *   2. one more test after the loop, because the loop steps after testing;
 *   3. `pg_backtrack_iters` BISECTIONS back along [u_task, u_feas] — bisection,
 *      not a secant, because Qhat is a sin-MLP and is not monotone along that
 *      segment, and because bisection always returns the FEASIBLE side;
 *   4. NON-CONVERGENCE: a row the ascent never made feasible returns `u_safe`
 *      at alpha 1 (exactly what the secant does when it exhausts its budget)
 *      and is counted in `pgInfeasible`, so a mistuned eta/N stays visible.
 *
 * THE GRADIENT. Python gets it from autograd through
 * `robust_q(obs, u) = critic(obs, u, dstb(obs, u))`, so what it returns is the
 * TOTAL derivative dQ/du + (dQ/dd)(d pi_d/du) — the adversary is conditioned on
 * u and is deliberately NOT detached (filtered_action.py:696-698). Here that is
 * a hand-written reverse pass through the two small MLPs (`makeTapedNet`):
 * backprop 1 through the twin head that WON the pessimistic max, take its
 * [62:74] slice for dQ/du and its [74:80] slice as the seed for backprop 2
 * through the adversary, take THAT [62:74] slice, add. One reverse pass costs
 * about one forward pass; finite differences would cost 12 forwards per
 * iteration and would not fit the 20 ms control step.
 *
 * The secant is kept (`intervention: 'line_search'`) because tests/filter_fixture.json
 * is a python trace of it and it is the only reference for the shared cascade.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * There is no RUN/GUARD/HANDBACK state machine. `GameQcbfShieldAction` builds
 * the shield with `sup_enabled=False, guard_enabled=False` (literals,
 * game_qcbf_action.py:181-183) and `kin_enabled = (filter.tilt_guard is not
 * None)` = False for this bundle — its deploy.yaml `filter:` block has no
 * `tilt_guard` key, only the comment saying why (bundle params/deploy.yaml:166,
 * "Tilt/kin channel OFF"). So `make_inmemory_shield` parks
 * `value_guard = -1e9` (exit_driver.py:700-703) and the `danger` test at
 * filtered_action.py:494 is identically False. The yaml's own `value_eps:
 * -1.0e9` says the same thing from the deploy side. recon/03:216-228 spells it
 * out: the mode machine never leaves RUN, the integrator reseed never fires,
 * and `guard_min_dwell / handback_ramp / handback_gate_*` are dead code.
 * Porting them would be porting dead branches.
 *
 * `fallback_line_search` is False (make_inmemory_shield default, never
 * overridden by the action term), so the out-of-set rows really do snap to
 * `u_safe` at alpha 1 — NOT to the `_best_effort` argmax a neighbouring lane
 * uses (recon/03:260-265). `full_takeover` is False the same way, so the
 * `need_ls` rows really do reach a solver.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * THE 62-D OBSERVATION
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * `game_qcbf_action._assemble_obs` (lines 295-331) is the code of record:
 *
 *   idx    dim  content                                            source
 *   0:3    3    root_link_lin_vel_b     base linear velocity, BODY frame
 *   3      1    roll                    euler_xyz_from_quat, re-wrapped atan2(sin,cos)
 *   4      1    pitch                   same
 *   5:8    3    root_link_ang_vel_b     body-frame angular velocity
 *   8:20   12   joint_pos               ABSOLUTE radians (not q - q_default!)
 *   20:32  12   joint_vel
 *   32:36  4    foot contact flags      ContactSensor.data.found > 0, FL FR RL RR
 *   36:48  12   prev_ctrl               the FILTER's own last output u_sel
 *   48:52  4    wall margins            [hx-x, hx+x, hy-y, hy+y], clamped ABOVE at 1.5
 *   52:54  2    heading                 (cos yaw, sin yaw), L2-normalized
 *   54:62  8    opponent tail           opponent_kinematics, ego yaw frame
 *
 * Four traps, all of which silently give a plausible-looking wrong answer:
 *   1. obs[8:20] is ABSOLUTE joint position. The 60-D game obs uses
 *      `q - q_default`; this one does not (recon/03:546-548).
 *   2. obs[36:48] is the FILTER's output, not the policy's action
 *      (recon/03:543-545).
 *   3. The wall rectangle is the BUNDLE's 4.8 x 3.0 at the env origin, NOT the
 *      scenario's 5.2 x 3.0 at (0.2, 0). The asym preset leaves `field_size`
 *      None, so the certificate reads a first margin of `2.4 - x` and only goes
 *      negative in the last 0.4 m of the 0.9 m run-out. That is what it was
 *      trained on; reproduce it, do not fix it (recon/03:534-541).
 *   4. `d` is clamped only from ABOVE (3.0) and stays negative while
 *      penetrating; the margins are clamped only from above (1.5) and go
 *      negative outside the box (recon/03:552-554).
 *
 * The opponent tail (`safety_collision/mdp/observations.py:54-124`) is a
 * rect-rect distance between two COLLIDE_HALF (0.29, 0.193) hulls whose centres
 * sit 0.05 m ahead of base_link along body x (`collide.py:_planar_pose`), plus a
 * SPLIT HORIZON: past a raw `d >= 1.5` the seven direction/motion channels blank
 * to `[d, 0,0,0,0,0, 1, 0]` while `d` itself stays live out to 3.0.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * GAIN BLEND — ON by default, because that is the plant the policy learned on
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The filter stiffens its seat from walk-soft 20/20/40 to 100/100/200 while it
 * intervenes (`touchdown_driver.py:42-44` `_WALK_KP`/`_STIFF_KP`/`_KD`,
 * `gain_blend.py:63-64` for the blend formula), through a rate-limited,
 * contact-gated `gain_alpha` (`derive_gain_alpha`, touchdown_driver.py:129-143)
 * that rises 1/8 per control step (`GameQcbfShieldActionCfg.gain_rise_steps = 8`,
 * game_qcbf_action.py:382 — the bundle yaml's `gain_rise_steps: 15` is the C++
 * lane, not this one) and holds while all four feet are airborne
 * (`gain_contact_gated = True`, game_qcbf_action.py:385).
 *
 * `game_qcbf_action.py:238` disables the blend when `num_envs == 1`:
 * `self._gain_blend = cfg.gain_blend and self.num_envs > 1 and self._has_field`.
 * The browser IS a single environment — but the browser is also the thing that
 * has to LOOK right, and the 8192-env fleet that produced these weights trained
 * with the blend ON for both seats (`cfg.gain_blend` defaults True,
 * game_qcbf_action.py:378; the DR-Wide arm leaves it alone, game_dr/__init__.py:392-400
 * — "本来filter都是那个kpkd，一直都是这个逻辑"). The `num_envs == 1` guard is a
 * MuJoCo tiling limitation, not a filter law: mjlab only tiles
 * `actuator_gainprm` per env when nworld > 1 (gain_blend.py:12-15), and this
 * runtime has no such limit. So we follow the MULTI-ENV behaviour and blend;
 * a soft-legged brace is not what the policy was trained to brace with.
 * `{gainBlend: false}` pins walk-soft for an A/B.

 * A loaded app/policy.js MLP, re-run so the reverse pass can see the tape.
 *
 * The forward is the SAME arithmetic as `MlpPolicy.forward` — same four-way
 * float64 accumulation, same float32 store per layer, so `robustQ` below is
 * numerically what it has always been — with one addition: the PRE-activation
 * of every layer is kept, because `sin` is not invertible from its output and
 * the backward pass needs `cos(z)`.
 *
 * The backward is the ordinary reverse-mode chain, in float64 (a gradient is a
 * direction; nothing downstream rounds it to float32):
 *
 *     head:   dL/dz_last = dL/dy * (1 - y^2)   for the tanh heads (ctrl, dstb)
 *                        = dL/dy               for the bare linear twin heads
 *     layer:  dL/dx      = W^T dL/dz
 *     sin:    dL/dz_prev = dL/dx * cos(z_prev)
 *
 * It costs the same multiply-accumulates as the forward, which is the whole
 * reason `_projected_gradient` is affordable at 50 Hz: 12-dimensional finite
 * differences would be 12 forwards per ascent step, 25 ascent steps deep.
 *
 * Only the shipped architecture is accepted (sin between layers; tanh or linear
 * head) — an unknown activation must fail loudly, not silently differentiate
